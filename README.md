# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
This project uses ESLint to set up a linter to find errors and maintain code consistency. A database was itialized with MongoDB for storing user and clothing item data. Schemas were set up to use for validation of requests between the routes and controllers for both users and clothing items.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
